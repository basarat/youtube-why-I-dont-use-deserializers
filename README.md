## Narration
Bonjor, in this video I present an example of a simple processing of a JSON response and why you might not need a serialization / deserialization library.

> Play intro

Let's create a mock JSON api to show the kind of data you might have to deal with in the real world. 

> Start with empty `api.ts`

* We have a type annotation for users that have a first name, optional middle names, and a last name.
* And an example `loadUser` which provides an example async response using some mock data.

> As always, thanks for watching, and I would love to hear your thoughts and idea on serialization and deserialization of JSON in the comments below. Au revoir.
